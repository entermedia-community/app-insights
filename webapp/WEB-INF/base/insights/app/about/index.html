        <h2>Why use MITRE Insights?</h2>
        <p>MITRE Insights uses the power of IBM Watson to give you the most relevant, cross-cutting results to provide a landscape view about a particular domain area in one place. Use MITRE Insights for
            <ul>
                <li>Discovering the breadth of MITRE knowledge</li>
                <li>New business development</li>
                <li>Work shaping</li>
                <li>Finding Domain POCs</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>What makes MITRE Insights so powerful?</h2>
        <p>MITRE Insights is powered by the MITRE Smart Data Layer (SDL) which incorporates Watson Discovery to create an artificial-intelligence pipeline. This AI pipeline applies machine learning and natural language processing to read unstructured content collections, parse documents into passages and match those passages to relevant entities, such as projects, people, or technical capability areas. The SDL automatically extracts keywords, identifies matching concepts, and generates document summaries. Using these "semantic clues," a user can more easily find relevant content without opening and reading the document.</p>
        <p>Continuous relevancy training makes the Watson Content Recommender smarter over time. The more you use it, and provide feedback, the smarter it becomes. This release contains a subset of data sources relating to Artificial Intelligence, but future releases will incorporate other high-value MITRE domain areas.</p>

        <h2>Data Sources Powering MITRE Insights</h2>
        <p>MITRE Insights contains a growing collection of high-value, low sensitivity content from authoritative enterprise data sources, including MITRE Contracts, MITRE Product Library, The Public Release Repository, Enterprise Data Services, the Platforms and Capabilities Portal, and Project Pages. We are always working to add new data sources and improve data quality. We would love to hear your ideas for new data sources or ways to improve existing data sources.

        <h2>MITRE Insights vs. Discovery Bar Search</h2>
        <p>MITRE Insights lets you search in a new way that our other search engines cannot do today. A Project Pages discover bar search on "machine learning" will bring you back project pages that mentioned that exact phrase. A MITRE Insights search will bring you items related to machine learning and will provide you a cross-cutting array of item types including Domain POCs, Contracts/Project Work Statements (PWS), MIP Research Projects, Direct Projects, Products from MPL, Capabilities, Platforms, and Public Release documents all in one view to give you a comprehensive view of all the knowledge across MITRE.</p>

        <h2>What's Next for MITRE Insights</h2>
        <p>MITRE Insights is currently in its early stages. As an Initial Operating Capability or IOC, it has limited capabilities, but this is just the first step; we have a lot planned for the future of MITRE Insights. We will be adding more domain areas so you can discover the MITRE knowledge around more topics than just Artificial Intelligence. We will also be making continual updates to the search, filters, and UI to improve the experience.</p>

        <h2>More about how MITRE Insights works</h2>
        <p>We combine commercial AI cloud services with best of breed open source tools and Semantic Web technologies to manage the AI lifecycle, share AI artifacts and deliver AI services that can converse with us in natural language, interpret our needs, and provide quick answers our questions</p>
        <p>Semantic Web technologies are unique in their ability to represent rich relations in powerful, easily extensible W3C standards. By capturing relations between entities like organizations, people, topic areas, and locations, this highly interconnected graph provides a cross-sectional view of the enterprise uncovering new insights not previously possible without locating and reading the content from multiple sources. Encoding our graphs using W3C standards also makes them compatible with a large cache of shared vocabularies, data sets, and tools that can further enrich potential use cases and facilitate reuse.</p>
